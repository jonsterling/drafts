title: Coinduction in JonPRL for Low Low Prices
tags: jonprl

So as a follow up to my prior [tutorial on JonPRL][tutorial] I wanted
to demonstrate a nice example of JonPRL being used to prove something

 1. Interesting
 2. Unreasonably difficult in Agda or the like

    *I think I'm asking to be shown up when I say stuff like this...*

I would like to implement the conatural numbers in JonPRL but without
a notion of general coinductive *or* even inductive types. Just the
natural numbers. The fun bit is that we're basically going to lift the
definition of a coinductively defined set straight out of set theory
into JonPRL!

## Math Stuff

First, let's go through some math. How can we formalize the notion of
an inductively defined set?

## The Code

## The Clincher
