title: Compiling a Lazy Language to JavaScript
tags: haskell, compilers

The last couple of days I've been working on a fun little compiler
called [f2js][github]. This compiler maps a lazy functional
language with records, a few primitives, higher order functions, and
pattern matching to JavaScript. In this post I'd like to outline how
this process works.
