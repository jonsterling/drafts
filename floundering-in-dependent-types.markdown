title: Not Another Dependent Types Sales Pitch
---

For the past 20 months I've been floundering in depedently typed
land. Not that it's the worst thing in the world of course, I've
learned so much from it.

I think that it might be worth writing down
some of my experiences to shorten someone's floundering from 20 months
to maybe only 14.

## Prerequisites

It's worth being up front about this. **I don't think you can jump
easily from Python to writing dependently typed code**. Sorry.

Writing a dependently typed language is the confluence of a lot of
unfortunate factors for beginners

 - [Almost Always] Purely Functional
 - Fancy Types
 - Academic Level Documentation
 - Very Few Tools

Now this might change in the next 5, 10, 15 years. In the here in now,
however, I think we'll have to accept the fact that there is enough of
a barrier that some intermediate languages are in order.

If you'd like to write some serious dependently typed code, I'd say
you should know a bit about one or more of the following

 - SML
 - OCaml
 - Haskell
 - Scala
