\begin{abstract}
Logical relations are a powerful tool in PLT. In particular it
provides an elegant method of proving properties that don't follow
cleanly from obvious methods of induction.

In this ``paper'', we'll step through a proof of algorithmic
equivalence for STLC as well as parametricity in System F to motivate
and demonstrate logical relations.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This paper is laid out into 5 parts. First we define simply typed
lambda calculus (STLC) and as well as System F. We'll also step
through the definitions of a few basic judgments such as typing. 

We then set out on a doomed mission to prove the sanity of an
equivalency equivalence relation without major contortions or logical
relations.

Next we introduce logical relations and define such a relation across
STLC and System F. In this section we'll also prove that they have
pleasant properties

We'll then use these relationships to prove our algorithm and
parametricity respectively.

\section{Definitions}
In order to play with logical relations we first must define a few
different languages to use and experiment with.

Let's start with simply typed lambda calculus.

\begin{grammar}
<type> ::= \top \alt <type> \rightarrow <type>

<exp>  ::= <var>
       \alt <exp> <exp>
       \alt \lambda <var> : <type> . <exp>
       \alt \top
\end{grammar}

There's nothing much to say about this grammar, it's worth noting that
we've overloaded $\top$ to be both a type and a value. The typing
and evaluation rules are the really interesting bit.

\begin{gather*}
  \inference[tvar]{v : t \in \Gamma}{\Gamma |- v : t} \\\\
  \inference[tunit]{}{\Gamma |- \top : \top}          \\\\
  \inference[tlam]{\Gamma, v : t |- e : t'}
            {\Gamma |- \lambda v : t.\; e}            \\\\
  \inference[tapp]{\Gamma |- f : t -> t' \quad \Gamma |- a : t}
                 {\Gamma |- f\;a : t'}                \\\\
  \inference[eunit]{}{\Gamma |- v -> v}               \\\\
  \inference[eunit]{}{\Gamma |- \top -> \top}         \\\\
  \inference[eapl]{\Gamma |- f -> f'}
            {\Gamma |- f\;a -> f'\;a}                 \\\\
  \inference[eapr]{\Gamma |- a -> a'}
            {\Gamma |- f\;a -> f\;a'}                 \\\\
\end{gather*}
