One particularly nifty thing I've been reading about lately is modal
logic. This is a family of logics that talk about different "modes" of
truth.

One way to picture this is a particular modal logic is like a set of
world. Each of these worlds has it own set of rules and
judgments. Some of these worlds subsume others, so it makes sense that
if `A true` in world `P`, then `A* true` in `Q`.

In a more concrete sense, we usually talk about 3 particular worlds in
modal logic. First is the normal truth we are used to. Second is □,
read "necessary". This is the strictest world, in it is the set of all
things that are "necessarily true" and don't depend on normal
hypothetical context. Finally there is ♢ or possibility. This is the
opposite of □, all things that are true are possible, but possible
things may depend on other possible hypotheses.

Modal logic provides a framework for us to discuss these
interdependent worlds and make statements and proofs in them.
