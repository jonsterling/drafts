Hi again. In the last [post][last-post] we talked a bit about the
natural deductions and proved a few theorems about it. Mostly, we
talked about local soundness and completeness. One thing that bothered
me a bit was the "local" prefix. We can prove that the elimination
rules of our system balance out, but what about the system as a whole?
How can we guarantee properties about it?

If we want to state something like local soundness and completeness on
a global scale, we first need to figure out what the equivalent of a
"reduced" and "expanded" proofs are.

## Verifications
## Usages
## A Calculus of Verifications and Uses
## Global Soundness and Completeness
