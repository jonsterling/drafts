title: Notes on Quotients Types
---

Lately I've been reading a lot of type theory literature. One of the
things that struck me was that a lot of this stuff wasn't complicated,
it was just hard to find that original, simple introduction. I suppose
this makes sense, no researcher wants to summarize the last 50 years
of research for a small result! It mean that I have to apply more
google-fu than I would like to understand what's going on.

In effort to help my future self, I'm going to jot down a few thoughts
on quotient types, the subject of some recent google-fu.
