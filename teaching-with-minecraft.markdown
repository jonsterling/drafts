title: Teaching Python with a Raspberry Pi
---

This last week I've been volunteering at a summer camp. This camp is
aimed at kids ages 8 to 12 and teaches the basics of Python!

I wanted to write down some of my thoughts and experiences on the
whole process.

## The Curriculum

The curriculum for the camp was based around 3 key components

 - Python
 - Raspberry Pis
 - Minecraft

The camp was spread over 4 3 hour days.
